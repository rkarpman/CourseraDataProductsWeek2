My top three places for coffee and sweets. Enjoy!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
cafe_locations <- data.frame(lat = c(39.9775933, 39.9841547, 39.9824757),
                 lng = c(-83.0038307, -82.999437, -83.0040125))
cafe_names <- c("One Line Coffee", "Fox in the Snow Cafe", "Laughlin's Bakery")

cafe_locations %>%
    leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(popup = cafe_names) %>%
    setView(lat = 39.9807, lng = -83, zoom = 15)
```
